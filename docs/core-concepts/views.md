# Views

A view is used for adding, editing and reading database entries.  
It consist of multiple formfields which are assigned to different fields in your database table.

### Adding a view

After you created a BREAD for your table, you can add as many views to it as you want.  
Just click the `Add View` button and you are prompted to enter the name of the view. The name can be anything you want.

### Adding a formfield

After you created at least one view, you can now add formfields to it. To do so, just click `Add Formfield` and a dropdown with all possible options will open.  
After you clicked the one you want, you can now change its options to your desire.

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure to assign the field \(the column in the database-table\) to your formfield, otherwise the formfield has no use.
{% endhint %}

### Resizing a formfield

You can resize the width of all formfields. Do this by clicking the arrow in the top right corner of the formfield.

{% hint style="info" %}
Be aware that this width will also be used for mobile users - so don't make formfields too small. Different sizes for different resolutions might come in a later version.
{% endhint %}

### Moving a formfield

To move a formfield to another position, just click and hold the handle and drag it to the position where you want it to be.
