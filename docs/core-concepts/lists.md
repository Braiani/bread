# Lists

A list is used for browsing a BREAD. It has as much formfields as you want and has various options to tweak its behaviour.

Except for resizing, the workwise of lists is the same as for [views](views.md).

### Field

The field is the column in your database-table where data is read from. It can also be an [accessor ](accessors.md)or a [relationship-field](untitled.md) if your model has them.

### Title

The title is shown in the header of the browse-table.

### Searchable

This checkbox gives you the ability to make the field searchable. Be aware that searching for a relationship-field is very resource intensive.

### Orderable

Is this field orderable or not.

### First ordered

The first time you visit the BREAD-browse page, the list will be ordered by this field.
