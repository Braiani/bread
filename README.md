# Voyager Bread Builder

Voyager package which allows you to build extensive BREAD Views and Lists. This is currently heavy **WIP** and not usable!

## Installation

Require the package:
```bash
composer require emptynick/voyager-bread
```
That's it. Go to your adminpanel and go to `Tools > BREAD`

## Todo:

There is too much to do to write it all down at the moment.

## Bugs:

* A lot right now
